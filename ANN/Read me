Deep Learning: Customer churn modelling
•	Build a multi-layer Artificial Neural Network using Keras library to solve the classification problem and identified the customers who are at the highest risk of leaving the Bank
•	Applied Gradient descent, dropout regularization on the hidden layers, and Grid search CV for better accuracy
